Is the game too easy or hard?
A= It depends on the game, because sometimes the balls enter the goal area without your actions, and sometimes the balls go around the arena forever. 
So, it can be both easy or hard.

What mould you make it easier or harder?
A= It will be harder if we make fake balls to trick the player to push them into the goals instead of the original. 
Also, we can make the game easier if we remove the chaos balls somehow so the last ones remaining in the arena can be the color balls.

What would give it a "wow" factor?
A= I think if we can have like a chaos ball that it is more like a black hole so it can retain and changed the direction from the color balls.

What parts of the game are fun? 
A= the fun part is that you can changed the direction of everything just by standing there with the bumper.

What parts of the game are tedious?
A= obviously, the chaos balls when there just one color ball remaining because they get in the way so mamny times. Also, sometimes the game finish before you can play the game because the color balls get in their goals by themselves.
